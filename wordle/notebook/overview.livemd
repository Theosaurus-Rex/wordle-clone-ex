# wordle_ex Notebook

## Introduction

wordle_ex is an implementation of the Wordle game in Elixir, developed using TDD(Test Driven Development).

This notebook can be run in [Livebook](https://livebook.dev) and provides a live access to the wordle_ex code. Instructions for connecting this notebook to the project can be found in this [blog post](https://fly.io/blog/livebook-for-app-documentation/).

## The Guess Module

The Guess module provides the `guess` function for checking a player guess against a secret word. It returns a `word_guess_result` showing the success or otherwise of the guess.

```elixir
Guess.guess("abc", "def")
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
[incorrect: "a", incorrect: "b", incorrect: "c"]
```

```elixir
Guess.guess("def", "efd")
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
[partial: "d", partial: "e", partial: "f"]
```

```elixir
result = Guess.guess("abc", "ace")
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
[correct: "a", incorrect: "b", partial: "c"]
```

```elixir
result
|> Enum.map(fn {r, _} ->
  case r do
    :correct -> "ðŸŸ©"
    :partial -> "ðŸŸ¨"
    _ -> "â¬œ"
  end
end)
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
["ðŸŸ©", "â¬œ", "ðŸŸ¨"]
```
